# Applied Statistics Projects - TUM Data Science & Statistical Thinking

This repository showcases statistics and data science projects I completed as part of the **Data Science and Statistical Thinking** course at **TUM**.
These projects allowed me to gain hands-on experience in **data manipulation, visualization, statistical modeling, and predictive analysis** using R and Quarto (`.qmd`).

## Projects Overview

- **Whickham Data Analysis:** Explores longitudinal data to study the effect of smoking and age on mortality.  
- **Birthweight Modeling:** Investigates predictors of infant birth weight using linear regression and cross-validation.  
- **Credit Defaults & Bootstrap:** Analyzes credit default probabilities with logistic regression and explores bootstrap sampling.  
- **Blackjack & Monte Carlo Simulation:** Uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate probabilities in speeding events and blackjack hands.

## Repository Structure

- Each project folder contains the **Quarto source files (`.qmd`)**, datasets, and tasks.  
- The **rendered HTML reports** are in the `docs/` folder, which can be viewed interactively via GitHub Pages.

This repository showcases my practical experience in **data science, statistical thinking, and machine learning workflow**.
